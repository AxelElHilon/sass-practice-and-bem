            CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more
            complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can
            help. Sass has features that don’t exist in CSS yet like nesting,
            mixins, inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write
            robust, maintainable CSS. Once you start tinkering with Sass, it
            will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS
            file that you can use in your website. The most direct way to make
            this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can
            compile your Sass to CSS using the sass command. You’ll need to tell
            Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to. For
            example, running sass input.scss output.css from your terminal would
            take a single Sass file, input.scss, and compile that file to
            output.css.
